            (Healing Hearts) program, one of the foundation’s main programs,
            provides surgeries at no cost to underprivileged children with
            congenital heart disease.
          </p>
          <hr />
        </div>
        <p className='text-justify mt-6'>
          Approximately 8,000 Thai children are suffering from congenital heart
          disease each year, with half requiring surgery. Without surgery, many
          of these children risk severe health complications or even death. Most
          of these children come from underprivileged families, although with
          the current government health insurance program, these children are
          often able to receive their needed heart surgeries.
        </p>
        <p className='text-justify mt-6'>
          However, even with government assistance, there are still restrictions
          on the number of pediatric patients who can undergo surgery each year.
          As a result, there are many children at any given time awaiting
          surgery — with the number increasing with each year. Due to this
          reason, the Bumrungrad International Hospital Foundation together with
          Bumrungrad International Hospital are doing their parts in social
          responsibility in helping to provide these children with charitable
          heart surgeries.
        </p>
        <p className='text-justify mt-6'>
          Bumrungrad’s medical teams are proud to offer their experience and
          expertise, while utilizing state-of-the-art medical equipment to
          perform these often highly-complicated heart surgeries.
        </p>
        <p className='text-justify mt-6'>
          Since 2003, the Rak Jai Thai program has provided more than 820 heart
          surgeries to underprivileged children with congenital heart disease
          (number as of August 1, 2021). The average cost of each surgery is
          750,000 baht
        </p>
        <p className='text-justify mt-6'>
          Concerning the costs of these surgeries, the program covers all
          expenses of the patient’s treatment — from diagnosis to surgery to
          other hospital fees. The program also takes care of travel expenses,
          food expenses, and accommodation for parents or guardians. This
          ensures that families with financial hardships can bring their loved
          ones to Bumrungrad for treatment

        <p className='text-justify mt-6'>
          The Bumrungrad International Hospital Foundation and Bumrungrad
          International Hospital have been supporting the villagers of the
          Nikhom Kham Soi and Khamcha-i Districts of the Mukdahan Province by
          purchasing their hand-woven wicker baskets to present toiletries in
          Bumrungrad’s inpatient rooms. This project is a joint effort between
          Bumrungrad International Hospital, the Bangkok Insurance Foundation,
          and the Bumrungrad Hospital Foundation.
        </p>
        <p className='text-justify mt-6'>
          Over a short period, higher-quality wicker products were developed —
          more detailed and even more beautiful — which has caught the eye of
          the general public. The production of these products has also
          increased significantly. Bumrungrad has been helping the people in
          these communities maintain a stable income, as well as maintain a
          better quality of life. And just as importantly, helping in keeping
          this basket weaving tradition alive.
